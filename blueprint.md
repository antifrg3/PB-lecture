# Personalized News App Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for creating a personalized news application. The app will allow users to select their interests and view a customized news feed based on those selections. The application will be built using modern web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface.

## Core Features

*   **Interest Selection:** Users can choose from a predefined list of topics (e.g., Technology, Sports, Business).
*   **Personalized Feed:** The main view will display a feed of news articles fetched from a news API, filtered by the user's selected interests.
*   **Modern UI:** The application will have a visually appealing design with a responsive layout that works on both desktop and mobile devices.
*   **Web Components:** We will use Web Components to create reusable UI elements for things like news articles and selection buttons.

## Phase 1: Initial Setup & UI

1.  **Project Scaffolding:** Create the basic `index.html`, `style.css`, and `main.js` files.
2.  **HTML Structure:** Define the main layout in `index.html`, including a header, an area for interest selection, and a container for the news feed.
3.  **Styling:** Apply initial CSS to create a clean and modern look and feel.
4.  **JavaScript Core:** Set up the basic JavaScript structure in `main.js` and implement a placeholder for fetching and displaying news.
